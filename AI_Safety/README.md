# AI Safety 

## Introduction
My interest in AI saftey began in December of 2025. After struggling to find things that I was really passionate in I was sent a job posting at Anthropic by a friend and started looking into AI alignment. I listened to a few podcasts from 80,000 Hrs and the AI X-risk Research Podcast. This sparked tons of interest for me and I started looking at what I could do to learn more. I am still really early stage in my learning but my commitment is high and my motivation strong.
