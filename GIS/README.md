# GIS

## Introduction
Spatial data analysis is really powerful. I am eager to learn more. Recently I completed a course in coding for geographers. I am eager to utilize tools to analyze spatial patterns in topics like environmental science, sustainability, and natural disasters

## Current Projects and Work
1. I am taking a course called *Spatial Analysis of Environmental Data* that I hope to learn lots from and present a research poster. I will update more here as it comes.
