## Introduction
Hey there! My name is Austin Child. Welcome to my personal project and coding sample page. Hopefully you find what you need. Here is a little bit about me:

My 3 favorite things are sunshine through the window, cool breezes, and being happy. You can find me spending time with the people I love, outside, doing a deep dive on topics related to AI, or studying (graduating 12/2026 in applied mathematics).
