# Data Analytics & Machine Learning

## Introduction
I believe that one of the greatest tools today for decision making is machine learning and data analytics. While I am not your best data analyst or machine learning engineer I am deeply motivated and want to learn. I am most interested in utilizing machine learning to better humanity. Some topics I am most interested in are climate change, environmental science, education, & natural disasters.
